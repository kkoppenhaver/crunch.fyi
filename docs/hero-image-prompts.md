## 1. Diagonal Stripes

### 1a - Varying Widths
```
Create an abstract hero image with bold diagonal stripes in forest green (#0a8935) on a clean white background. The stripes should vary in width from thin to thick, with soft rounded ends rather than hard cuts. Style it like a 1970s poster design with subtle film grain texture throughout. The composition should be clean and graphic, feeling warm and tactile like vintage print material. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 1b - Halftone Transition
```
Create an abstract hero image with diagonal stripes in forest green (#0a8935) that transition from solid color to halftone dots as they travel across the frame. White background. The stripes should converge toward the bottom right corner, creating dynamic movement. Retro print aesthetic like a 1970s magazine advertisement. Include subtle paper texture and warm film grain. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 1c - Layered Depth
```
Create an abstract hero image with layered diagonal stripes set at slightly different angles to create depth. Forest green (#0a8935) stripes with varying opacity levels on white background. Soft shadows fall between the layers suggesting the stripes are floating on different planes. Inspired by 1970s Swiss graphic design. Clean, minimal, sophisticated. Subtle film grain texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.

## 2. Radiating Angular Beams

### 2a - Corner Burst
```
Create an abstract hero image with bold angular beams radiating outward from the bottom left corner. Forest green (#0a8935) beams on white background. Dramatic perspective with beams spreading across the entire frame. 1970s graphic design style like a vintage corporate annual report cover. Sharp geometric rays with a subtle cream tint in the shadow areas. Film grain texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 2b - Center Sunburst
```
Create an abstract hero image with radiating beams bursting from the center of the frame. Alternating segments of forest green (#0a8935) and white, creating a retro sunburst pattern. Slight fisheye distortion warping the beams. Aesthetic of a vintage science textbook cover or 1970s educational filmstrip. Warm and analog feeling with subtle film grain. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 2c - Asymmetric Rays
```
Create an abstract hero image with angular beams radiating from the top right corner. Forest green (#0a8935) that gradates to a slightly lighter green at the beam edges. White background. Asymmetric, dynamic composition. Inspired by Saul Bass film title sequences from the 1960s and 70s. Include film grain texture and a warm, tactile quality like vintage print material. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

## 3. Dot Matrix Wave

### 3a - Gradient Fade
```
Create an abstract hero image using a dot matrix pattern that forms a gentle wave shape. Forest green (#0a8935) circular dots on a cream-white background. The dots should be dense at the bottom of the frame and fade to sparse at the top, creating a gradient effect. Punch card and vintage computer printout aesthetic. Dots arranged in a precise grid. Retro 1970s data processing feel. Subtle paper texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 3b - S-Curve Flow
```
Create an abstract hero image with halftone dots in forest green (#0a8935) forming a flowing S-curve across a white background. The dots vary in size to suggest depth and movement—larger dots in the foreground, smaller receding. Style of 1970s print advertising and Ben-Day dots. Warm, tactile quality with subtle film grain. Clean and graphic composition. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 3c - Topographic Contours
```
Create an abstract hero image with a dot matrix pattern forming abstract topographic contours. Forest green (#0a8935) dots on white background. The dots are aligned in a strict grid, but their density varies to create organic hill and valley forms like elevation maps. Perforated paper texture. Vintage data visualization aesthetic from 1970s scientific publications. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

## 4. Hexagonal Tessellation

### 4a - Honeycomb Depth
```
Create an abstract hero image featuring a hexagonal honeycomb tessellation pattern in forest green (#0a8935). The hexagons should have subtle 3D depth with soft shadows suggesting they're raised from the surface. White background visible through small gaps between hexagons. Aesthetic blending 1970s bathroom tile with retro-futurism. Clean and geometric with a warm, tactile feel. Film grain texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 4b - Mixed Fill
```
Create an abstract hero image with a hexagonal grid pattern. Mix of solid filled hexagons and outline-only hexagons, all in forest green (#0a8935) on white background. Some hexagons appear slightly raised with subtle drop shadows. Mid-century modern pattern design aesthetic. Clean, repeating, hypnotic. The pattern should fill the frame edge to edge. Subtle texture and film grain. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 4c - Warped Grid
```
Create an abstract hero image with a warped hexagonal tessellation that creates a curved surface illusion. Forest green (#0a8935) hexagons on white background. The hexagons distort toward the center of the frame as if viewing through curved glass or a fisheye lens. Op-art influence creating visual depth. Retro-futuristic 1970s aesthetic. Clean lines with subtle film grain texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.

## 5. Interlocking Curved Puzzle

### 5a - Seamless Tessellation
```
Create an abstract hero image with interlocking curved puzzle shapes that tessellate seamlessly across the frame. Alternating forest green (#0a8935) and white shapes. Organic jigsaw pattern with smooth, flowing curves rather than traditional puzzle piece edges. Mid-century modern aesthetic like 1970s textile or wallpaper design. Flat design with subtle paper texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 5b - Organic Camouflage
```
Create an abstract hero image with flowing interlocked organic shapes resembling abstract camouflage. Forest green (#0a8935) forms on white background. Rounded, amoeba-like curves that fit together perfectly with no gaps. Inspired by 1970s textile patterns and Marimekko designs. Warm and playful yet sophisticated. Subtle film grain and tactile texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
```

### 5c - Floating Pieces
```
Create an abstract hero image with curved puzzle pieces in forest green (#0a8935) outlined by thin white lines. The pieces are slightly separated from each other, revealing the white background between them and creating a floating effect. Soft drop shadows under each piece. Playful yet sophisticated composition. Mid-century modern influence with retro-futuristic warmth. Film grain texture. Aspect ratio 16:9, high resolution.
